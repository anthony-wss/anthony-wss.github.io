[2025.03.28] New talk: invited talk in Prof. Hung-Yi Lee's Machine Learning 2025 course: Training LLMs with multiple GPUs -- [Watch the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpuRca2UZtI)✨

Hello! My name is **Hsiu-Hsuan Wang**.

I am an graduate student at Electrical Engineering Computer Science, National Taiwan University. Fortunate to have Prof. Hung-Yi Lee as the advisor for my Master's degree. My research interests include speech language modeling, speech recognition, and speech codec.

I write public journal at [Threads](https://www.threads.net/@tony.ai.engineer) with 2.9k+ followers.✨
