ðŸš€ [2024.01.19] New Blog Post: [ESPnet Hackathon 2023](/posts/2024/01/blog-post-1/)âœ¨

Hello! My name is **Hsiu-Hsuan Wang**, and I am an graduate student at Electrical Engineering Computer Science, National Taiwan University. Fortunate to have Prof. Hung-Yi Lee as the advisor for my Master's degree. My research interests include speech language modeling, speech recognition, and speech codec.

My undergraduate research projects involved weakly-supervised learning, supervised by **Prof. Hsuan-Tien Lin**, and speech dialogue modeling, supervised by **Prof. Hung-Yi Lee**.
