ðŸš€ [2024.01.19] New Blog Post: [ESPnet Hackathon 2023](/posts/2024/01/blog-post-1/)âœ¨

Hello! My name is **Hsiu-Hsuan Wang**, and I am an undergraduate student at National Taiwan University. I will join the Graduate Institute of Electrical Engineering (Computer Science group) to pursue my  my Master's degree. I am fortunate to have **Prof. Hung-Yi Lee** as my advisor for my Master's degree.

My undergraduate research projects involved weakly-supervised learning, supervised by **Prof. Hsuan-Tien Lin**, and speech dialogue modeling, supervised by **Prof. Hung-Yi Lee**.
